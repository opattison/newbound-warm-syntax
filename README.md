**newbound warm** is a calm, medium contrast theme for [Atom](https://atom.io), based on the hues and shades from [Oliver Pattisonâ€™s website](https://olivermak.es). Optimized for writing Markdown and front-end development, it should also work for general use.

See also: [newbound light](https://atom.io/themes/newbound-light-syntax) and [newbound dark](https://atom.io/themes/newbound-dark-syntax).

## Features

- Medium contrast without any dissonant color pairings
- Consistent support for syntax grammar across languages
- Carefully selected, [Base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16)-inspired palette, with blue and red accents
- Support for UIs that are responsive to hues from syntax themes, like the built-in [One Light UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-light-ui)
- Subtle `invisibles` (if enabled in Settings)
- Bracket matching style
- Suitable for monospace fonts without an italic variant

## Specific support for these syntaxes

- HTML
- (GitHub-flavored) Markdown
- Liquid
- CSS
- SCSS/Sass
- Less
- JavaScript
- JSON
- YAML
- Ruby
- todo

General support for other languages is intended but not guaranteed.

**newbound** is friendly toward [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) development, particularly if used with [liquid-language](https://atom.io/packages/language-liquid) support (not built-in).

Optimized for [One Light UI](https://atom.io/themes/one-light-ui) and [One Dark UI](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui).

## Install

This theme can be installed with the Atom package manager in the app or on the command line.

### Within Atom

Search in **Settings (Preferences) > Install** for this package.

### Or on a command line

`$ apm install newbound-warm-syntax`

After it is installed, it can be activated by going to the **Settings (Preferences) > Themes** section and selecting it from the **Syntax Theme** menu.

### Not using Atom?

Use the `colors.yml` file with hex color values with [Base16 Builder](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-builder) to generate a theme for a different text editor. This theme was created by hand, so results may vary from this implementation.
